# UPI_Data_Analysis_Course_Project

In this study, we analyzed beneficiary and remittance behaviour of popular banks facilitating UPI transactions, using K-mean clustering, rank analysis and time series analysis to identify transactional patterns.
Further, we conducted tests of significance to study the difference in remittance and beneficiary behaviour of nationalized and private banks, and top ranked banks with the other banks.
